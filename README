Backend Setup:

MongoDB Setup:
Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official MongoDB website.
Start MongoDB by running the following command in your terminal:
mongod

Seed Data:
Navigate to the backend folder in your project.
cd backend

Run the seed script to insert data into MongoDB:
node seedData.js

Run Backend Server:
npx nodemon
The server will run on http://localhost:3001


Frontend Setup:
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend folder in your project.
cd frontend

Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Run Frontend Server:
npm start

The frontend server will run on http://localhost:3000


Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000
The frontend should be running, and you can interact with the Question Paper Generator application.
With these steps, you have set up and run both the backend and frontend servers for your project. Adjust the MongoDB connection details in the backend if needed, and make sure the ports are not conflicting.

Please note that you may need to modify the CORS settings in your backend server to allow requests from http://localhost:3000 (the default React development server) if you encounter CORS-related issues.
